<h2>My best 3 movies</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>This Movie shows how difficult it is to avoid ourselves being institionalized while this being the easiest thing at the same time.
How dreams summed up with actions and intellect can lead to definite success. In this movie Andy Dufresne dreams about breaking free from
a prison and settle in a small town near Mexico next to the Pacific Ocean. At one point during his time at the prison, he mentions about the Pacific,
as said by the locals who live there. The line goes as : Do you know what they say about the Pacific? They say it has no memory.
</p>

<h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
<p>Shows how simplicity can be more valuable than complexity when it comes to decision making. The best way to describe this movie is by
relating the life of Forrest Gump To The lines of the song Imagine by John Lennon.
</p>

<h3>Schindler's List</h3>
<p>This movie shows how a small amount of merciful actions is way more satisfying than all the materialistic pleasures.
It also shows how miserable life can be. The movie points out the fact that every title, every position and all the riches
make no sense if not used for a reasonable cause, which in this movie was to save innocent Jews and brought into effect
by Oskar Schindler during the German Holocaust.</p>
